# qs8 Quantum Statevector Simulator
Using numpy to create a statevector-based simulator

### Python Dependencies
- numpy

### Roadmap
- [x] Adding standard or custom gates to a circuit
- [x] Interpreting single gates
- [x] Interpreting local multi-qubit gates
- [ ] Non-local multi-qubit gates
- [ ] Store circuit as unitary operation
- [ ] Initialize functionality
- [ ] Customizable dtype (complex128 is currently used)
